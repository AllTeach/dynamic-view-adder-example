# Android Step-by-Step Codelab: Dynamically Adding Views

## Introduction

In this codelab, you'll learn how to **add views dynamically in Java**—not just in XML.  
We'll start with the basics (adding one and then two buttons), and then move to the concept of adding a "row" (a horizontal LinearLayout) with multiple buttons as a child of your main layout.  
This will help you understand how dynamic UI works and how nested layouts give you flexibility.

## Step 1: Adding Buttons Directly

**1.1 XML Layout**

Start with a vertical LinearLayout in `activity_main.xml`:

```xml
<LinearLayout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:id="@+id/main"
    android:orientation="vertical"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">
</LinearLayout>
```

**1.2 Add One Button in Java**

In `MainActivity.java`, inside `onCreate`:

```java
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

    LinearLayout mainLayout = findViewById(R.id.main);

    Button btn = new Button(this);
    btn.setText("I'm a new button!");
    mainLayout.addView(btn);
}
```

**Expected result:**  
You see a single button on the screen.

**1.3 Add Two Buttons in Java**

After the code above, add another button:

```java
Button btn2 = new Button(this);
btn2.setText("Second Button");
mainLayout.addView(btn2);
```

**Expected result:**  
Two buttons appear, one below the other.

## Step 2: Motivation for Using Layouts

If you want buttons **side by side** (in a row), you need a container with horizontal orientation.  
Instead of adding buttons directly to the main (vertical) layout, you create a new horizontal LinearLayout (a "row") and add buttons to it.

## Step 3: Creating a Row with Two Buttons

```java
// Create a new horizontal LinearLayout (row)
LinearLayout rowLayout = new LinearLayout(this);
rowLayout.setOrientation(LinearLayout.HORIZONTAL);

// Create two buttons
Button btnA = new Button(this);
btnA.setText("Row Button 1");
rowLayout.addView(btnA);

Button btnB = new Button(this);
btnB.setText("Row Button 2");
rowLayout.addView(btnB);

// Add the row to the main vertical layout
mainLayout.addView(rowLayout);
```

**Expected result:**  
You see two buttons, side by side, in a row.

## Step 4: Explanation—Why Add a Layout?

- If you only add buttons directly to the main layout, they appear in a vertical column.
- By creating a **horizontal LinearLayout** and adding buttons to it, you create a "row" of buttons.
- You then add this row to the main vertical layout, so each row appears as a horizontal band among other items.
- This is called **nesting layouts**—placing layouts inside other layouts to control arrangement.

**Visual analogy:**  
The main layout is like a stack of trays (vertical). Each tray (row) can have several items side by side.

## Step 5: Theoretical Concepts

- **Layout Hierarchy:** The parent layout holds child layouts or views. By nesting, you decide how things are arranged.
- **Dynamic UI:** Creating layouts and views in Java lets your app respond to user input or data and change its interface on the fly.
- **Flexibility:** You can add, remove, or modify views and layouts at runtime, building interactive and adaptive UIs.

## Step 6: Challenge and Further Exploration

- Use a loop to add more buttons to your row.
- Add multiple rows to your main layout, each with a different number of buttons.
- Try changing the row to vertical orientation and see what happens.
- Try adding TextViews alongside Buttons in the row.
- Make each button respond to clicks with a Toast showing its number.

**Summary**  
Start by adding one button, then two, and then create a row (LinearLayout) to arrange buttons horizontally.  
This technique lets you build dynamic and flexible user interfaces in Android, using nested layouts and runtime logic!
